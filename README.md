# Watch Movies or TV Shows with IMDb or TMDb IDs

This HTML code allows you to watch movies or TV shows by using their IMDb or TMDb IDs. Below are the instructions on how to format and use it.

## Watching Movies or TV Shows

To watch a movie or TV show, simply use the IMDb or TMDb ID. You can search for these IDs by visiting the respective websites and looking at the URL.

### How to Get IMDb or TMDb ID

1. **IMDb ID**: 
   - Go to the IMDb page of the movie or TV show.
   - The IMDb ID is located in the URL. It typically starts with `tt` followed by a series of numbers. For example, for the movie *Inception*, the IMDb URL would be:
     ```
     https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/
     ```
     Here, `tt1375666` is the IMDb ID.

2. **TMDb ID**: 
   - Go to the TMDb page for the movie or TV show.
   - The TMDb ID is located in the URL and looks like a number in the URL. For example, for the movie *Inception*, the TMDb URL is:
     ```
     https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/27205-inception
     ```
     Here, `27205` is the TMDb ID.

### Anime Example

For anime, the format is slightly different. Hereâ€™s the example format for anime:
AnimeName*-episode-1[-sub|dub] (optional)

#### Example for Anime:

To watch episode 1 of *To Love Ru*, you can use the following format:
to-love-ru-episode-1


If you want to specify whether the episode is in sub or dub (subtitles or dubbed audio), you can add that information:

- For subtitles:
to-love-ru-episode-1-sub

- For dubbed:
to-love-ru-episode-1-dub

You can optionally add `-sub` or `-dub` after the episode number, depending on your preference.

## Important Notes:

- **Superembed Option**: This option is available for movies only. It allows for enhanced embedding functionality, which is not supported for TV shows or anime.

Enjoy watching your favorite content!
